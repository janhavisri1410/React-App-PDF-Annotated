# React-App-PDF-Annotated
The goal of the task is to build a React App that can be used to annotate PDF documents. You will be using React (other javascript frameworks, such as Angular, are not allowed) to implement the annotation functionality and integrate to backend API. Finally you will be deploying your app to Vercel (or similar platform where we can assess the functionalities). Partially implemented submissions will not be considered.
